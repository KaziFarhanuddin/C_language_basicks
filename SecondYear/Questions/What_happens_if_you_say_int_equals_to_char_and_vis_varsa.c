//This was an experiment and it failed because C is old 
//And its compillors have become pieces of trash
//People say a lot on how important it is but no one works on it to make it 
//better
//You wont even find any offecial work on it 
//Its nearly dead
//And failing to execute this program is one of the many examples of it
//I have worked on it for some minutes but wont even try to make it work
//As it would be a wast of my time
