/*
Void is empty 
That is nothing 
So Let this file be empty

By the you cannot declare a void variable
	So let it go, let it go, let it go ;)

But you can use it to define what datatype a function is returning
	but plz dont use "void main()" it bad practice and gcc will give you a 
	worning if not error, Happy codding.. :)
